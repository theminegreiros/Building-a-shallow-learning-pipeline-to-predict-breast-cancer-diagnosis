Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, being the second major cause of women's death. More than 9.8 million people died due to cancer only in 2018. Cancer has also a significant and increasing economic impact. The total annual economic cost of cancer was estimated at approximately 1.16 trillion USD in 2010. In the last few decades, several machine learning techniques have been developed for breast cancer detection and classification.
In this article you will learn how to build a machine learning pipeline to classify the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using python.
